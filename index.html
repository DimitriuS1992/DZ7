              <p class="main-text"> A total of 128 athletes compete across the four events: the men's individual, women's individual, men's team and women's team.
All four events were recurve archery events, held under the World Archery-approved 70-meter distance and rules. The competition started with an initial ranking round involving all 64 archers of each gender. Each archer would shoot a total of 72 arrows to be seeded from 1â€“64 according to their score.
The ranking round was also used to seed the teams from 1 to 12, by aggregating the individual scores for the members of each team.
Each event was played in a single-elimination tournament format, except for the semi-final losers, who would play off to decide the bronze medal winner.</p>

The host city Rio de Janeiro was announced at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2 October 2009. Rio became the first South American city ever to host the Olympic Games. These were the first games to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first summer edition to be held entirely in the host country's winter season, the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America, and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
