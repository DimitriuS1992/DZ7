All four events were recurve archery events, held under the World Archery-approved 70-meter distance and rules. The competition started with an initial ranking round involving all 64 archers of each gender. Each archer would shoot a total of 72 arrows to be seeded from 1â€“64 according to their score. The ranking round was also used to seed the teams from 1 to 12, by aggregating the individual scores for the members of each team. Each event was played in a single-elimination tournament format, except for the semi-final losers, who would play off to decide the bronze medal winner.</p>
